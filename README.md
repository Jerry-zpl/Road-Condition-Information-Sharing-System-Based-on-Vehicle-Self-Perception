# Road-Condition-Information-Sharing-System-Based-on-Vehicle-Self-Perception
We have 3 components in this project: On-board chips, Transmission chip & Data processing and visualization.
## On-board chips
Include GPS and Sensors. Arduino Mega 2560 is used to gather all information of whole car.
## Transmission chip
Include HC-12 chips, SIM7020C chips. Then we can send data from Mega 2560 and receive data with Arduino Uno which is connnected with computer.
## Data processing and visualization
Clean data and visualize data on Openstreet Map with Python.
